Lesson 1 (Blink):

- how to adjust the timing for the blinking of the arduino's 'L' LED

Lesson 2 (LED):

- Breadboard (purpose, build, etc.)
  - buses (+/- columns on edges) align vertically while the alphabetical rows align horizontally
- LED(purpose, build, etc.)
  - has positive and negative leads
  - must be used with a resistor to limit the amount of current flowing through it, or else, kaboom! (jk, or am I????)
  - 2 ways to tell which lead of the LED is positive
    - positive lead is longer
    - the negative lead enters the body of the LED, there is a flat edge to the case of the LED
    - NOTE: If you happen to have an LED that has a flat side next to the longer lead, you should assume that the longer lead is positive
- Resistors:
  - unit is called Ohm (usually shortened to Ω the Greek letter Omega)
  - denote the values of resistors in kΩ (1,000 Ω) and MΩ (1,000,000 Ω)
- used 3 different values of resistor (220Ω, 1kΩ, and 10kΩ)
  - resistors look the same, except they have different colored stripes

Lesson 3 (Button):

- Pull down resistor:
  - large resistor (Ex: 10kΩ) lined up to pull voltage of a pin down to a low amount
  - prevents short circuits and ensures the circuits only utilize 2 states (HIGH/LOW)
  - used in this case to detect when a button is NOT being pressed

Shopping cart:

- short jumper wires / spool of wires and wire strippers and make the short jumper wires yourself
- plastic pieces for user to press when playing game
- USB-A extension so PC isn't oriented in an unorthodox manner
- larger breadboard
